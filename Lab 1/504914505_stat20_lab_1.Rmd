```
## **1. Installing R & RStudio**
```{r}
system("whoami", intern = TRUE)
```
![Screenshot](Proof.png)

## **2. Installing Packages**
```{r}
find.package("tidyverse")
find.package("readr")
find.package("foreign")
```

## **3. Application of Basic R Rules**

### 3.1 Working with vectors and some vector math
#### A. Convert 79 F to Celsius
```{r}
(79 - 32) * (5 / 9)
```
#### B. Converting values in nhtemp to Celsius
```{r}
(as.numeric(nhtemp) - 32) * (5 / 9)
```
### 3.2 Character and Logical Vectors

#### A. Create a character vector: 
```{r}
words <- c("wrath", "avarice", "sloth", "pride", "lust", "envy", "gluttony")
```

#### B. Print only the last two elements of the character vector:
```{r}
words[(length(words) - 1):length(words)]
```

#### C. Why does d + 3 result in an error but b + 3 did not?
Note: The order of precedence from highest to lowest is ```character > numeric > logical```.  
```b + 3``` worked because coercion of logical values to numeric values simply turns ```TRUE``` into ```1```, and ```FALSE``` into ```0```. Now these newly converted elements can be used with binary operators like the ```+``` sign. However, ```d + 3``` doesn't work because ```d``` is a character matrix created from the character vector ```a``` and the logical vector ```b```. Since character has higher precedence than logical, the logical elements from ```b``` are converted to character values (```TRUE``` and ```FALSE``` become ```"TRUE"``` and ```"FALSE"```) in this case. All the elements in ```d``` are now character values and thus non-numeric, which explains why ```d + 3``` generates the error message: ```Error: non-numeric argument to binary operator```. 

### 3.3 Matrices

#### A. Three ways to create the matrix:  
```{r}
traditional <- matrix(49:20, nrow = 6, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
traditional # conventional method

row_bind <- rbind(49:45, 44:40, 39:35, 34:30, 29:25, 24:20)
row_bind 

column_bind <- cbind(c(49, 44, 39, 34, 29, 24),
                     c(48, 43, 38, 33, 28, 23),
                     c(47, 42, 37, 32, 27, 22),
                     c(46, 41, 36, 31, 26, 21),
                     c(45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20))
column_bind 

# transpose_method <- t(cbind(49:45, 44:40, 39:35, 34:30, 29:25, 24:20))
# transpose_method
```

#### B. Display the values in the 3rd row:
```{r}
traditional[3, ]
```

#### C. Display values in the 2nd and 4th column
```{r}
traditional[, c(2, 4)]
```
### 3.4 Data Frames
#### A. Identify a data set other than USArrests:
```{r}
data(BOD)
```

#### B. Using class() and mode() to check whether our dataset selected was appropriate:
```{r}
class(BOD)
mode(BOD)
```

#### C. Obtaining the number of observations and variables that our data frame has:
```{r}
str(BOD)
```

#### D. Data Extraction

* All data for California
* All values for UrbanPop
* All variables for the state with the lowest murder rate
* Only observations with a minimum UrbanPop of 85 or higher
```{r}
USArrests[5, ] # All data for California
USArrests[, 3] # All values for UrbanPop
USArrests[which.min(USArrests$Murder), ] # All variables for state with the lowest murder rate
USArrests[USArrests$UrbanPop >= 85, ] # Only observations with a minimum UrbanPop of 85 or higher
```
## **4. Writing Functions**

### A. Pseudocode

* Input temperature in Fahrenheit
  + Check if user entered a number
    - If false, then prompt the user to enter a valid number
  + Subtract 32 from the temperature
  + Multiply result by (5 / 9)
  + Store final result in a variable
* Output temperature in Celsius
  + Return the variable containing the final result

### B. Implementing Pseudocode
```{r Fahrenheit to Celsius Function}
fToC <- function(temp) {
  finalValue <- (temp - 32) * (5 / 9)
  return(finalValue)
}
```
